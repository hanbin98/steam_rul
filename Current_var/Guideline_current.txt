The Python files in this project are for battery life prediction with current as a key variable.
The implementation-oriented description of the code contents and their execution order is as follows:

1. data_split.py
Segregates all CSV files located under the 'data\all' directory into training and test datasets and saves them accordingly.

2. train_lgbm.py
Trains a LightGBM model that takes charging-protocol information as input and predicts four features(voltage, internal resistance, the mean of dQ/dV, and the variance of dQ/dV).
The trained model is saved to 'models\lgbm'.

3. train.py
Trains a 1D CNN-LSTM model. The trained model is exported to the 'export' directory.

4. test.py
Uses the saved model to select three datasets from the test set defined within the code, generates predictions, and saves the resulting plots.
